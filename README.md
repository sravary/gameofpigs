# Welcome to the Game of Pigs

Rules of the Game:
1. Each turn, a player rolls the die as many times as they wish and each result gets added to their ROUND score.
2. If a player rolls a 1, all their accumulated ROUND score will be lost and they lose their turn.
3. A player can click on HOLD, which adds their ROUND score to their GLOBAL score.
4. The first player to reach a 100 GLOBAL points wins the game.
